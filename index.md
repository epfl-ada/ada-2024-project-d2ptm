## Abstract

In today’s competitive job market, leveraging professional networks is crucial for securing top-tier positions.
But does the same apply to movie actors, where education might not play such a significant role?
To explore this, we examine whether an actor’s professional community shapes their success.
We build a graph where vertices represent actors, and edges connect those who have appeared in a movie together, **symbolizing a "friendship" between them**.
By clustering actors into communities, we investigate the role of friendships in shaping career trajectories.
Our analysis focuses on the U.S. movies but extends to films from other countries to determine if the conclusions are universal.
This study aims to reveal whether an actor’s community significantly impacts their career outcomes and how friendship patterns vary across time and countries.

## Research Questions

The topic of our research is: **does actor's friendships have and impact on his or her career?**

We will focus on the movies created in the USA.

To answer this question, we investigate the following sub-questions:

1. **Awards.** What are the chances that an actor gets an award?
   - Are awarded actors usually together in the same cluster? This means that either a cluster has many actors with awards or none.
2. **Revenue.** What is the influence of a community on the movie revenue?
   - _Deep Analysis of the top cluster_. What are the groups with the most financial success (e.g. highest average revenue / highest total revenue) and what are their characteristics?
   - _Cluster comparison analysis_. Do certain types of actor clusters (e.g., clusters featuring actors from diverse genres etc.) correlate with higher or lower revenues?
3. **Total Success.** Are the groups with the most awards (or nominations) also the groups with the highest revenue?

4. **Central Nodes.** Are there key actors (central nodes) whose presence significantly impacts the connectivity and composition of clusters?

5. **Time.** How do clusters evolve over time?
   - From which to which year has the cluster existed? Are clusters “compact” in time?
   - Do the characteristics of the leading actor group evolve over time?

While answering these questions provides a comprehensive analysis for the American movies, we want to understand how likely the same conclusions will hold for other countries.
Therefore, we will compare the clusters from the USA with the clusters from another country, e.g. India:

6. **Country-wise comparison**
   - Do the clusters have a significant distribution difference between these two countries (e.g., tend to be much smaller/bigger in size)?
   - What are the differences between top-one (revenue-wise) cluster for these countries in terms of distributions (age, genres, etc.)?
