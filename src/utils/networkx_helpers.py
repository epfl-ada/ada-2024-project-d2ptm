    The centrality score for each node is calculated as the mean of its betweenness, 
    closeness, and Katz centrality values, with the scores normalized to ensure consistency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        The input graph for which the combined centrality is to be computed.
    bet_centrality : dict
        A dictionary containing the betweenness centrality values for each node in the graph.

    katz : dict
        A dictionary containing the Katz centrality values for each node in the graph.

    """
    Visualizes the graph with node and edge attributes, saving the visualization to a file.

    The function generates a network visualization using a spring layout, where node sizes and 
    label font sizes are determined by the 'centrality' attribute. The graph is customized with 
    different colors for nodes, edges, and labels. The output is saved as an image file at the specified 
    path and also displayed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        The input graph to be visualized.
    output_path : str
        The file path where the generated graph visualization image will be saved.
    colors : list of str, optional
        A list of three color codes used for node labels, edges, and nodes respectively. 
        Defaults to ["#252A34", "#FF2E63", "#08D9D6"].
    k : float, optional
        The optimal distance between nodes in the spring layout. If None, the default layout is used.
    alpha : float, optional
        The transparency level of the edges, where 1.0 is fully opaque. Defaults to 1.0.
    node_shape : str, optional
        The shape of the nodes in the visualization (e.g., 'o' for circles). Defaults to 'o'.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        The function does not return any data but saves the visualization to the specified file path 
        and displays it.
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Node sizes and label font sizes are scaled based on the 'centrality' attribute of the nodes.
    - The 'centrality' values also control the transparency of the nodes and labels.
