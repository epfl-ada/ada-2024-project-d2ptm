## Possible research questions 

### Tim
- Do certain types of actor clusters (e.g., clusters featuring actors from diverse genres etc.) correlate with higher or lower revenues?
- Are there key actors (central nodes) whose presence significantly impacts the connectivity and composition of clusters?
- Do larger clusters, or clusters with specific characteristics, consistently yield movies with higher revenue or popularity?
